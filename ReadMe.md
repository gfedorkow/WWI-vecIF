# Whirlwind I Vector Graphics Interface

For showing a Whirlwind programme's output, a small hardware
generates vector strokes on two X/Y/Z oszilloskopes
and allows to attach two light guns.
Guy Fedorkow's WWI simulator (https://github.com/raigl/WWI-vecIF) running on a Raspberry (B+) 
can drive the interface and run some original WWI programmes.

## Basics

The interface allows to draw (short) vectors for two channels
on an analog x/y/z display, e.g. an oszilloscope.

The D/A converter used has an internal reference of 2.048V and 12 bits
resultion and produces 0..2.047V in steps of 1/4096. 
WWI uses 10 bits plus sign, i.e. +/- 1023.
Thus the coordinate unit corresponds to 1mV internally.
The output state amplifies by 2.5, thus supplies +/- 2.5V and 2.5mV per unit. 

Drawing a vector is done by setting two integrators to the start point,
then provide a speed and start the integrators for 50Âµs,
which provides a strobe for the z axis.
With maximum speed (-1023 or +1023, i.e. 0 or 2.047V), the movement is 1/8 of the full coordinate range -1.0 .. +1.0,
i.e. 256 coordinate units or 250mV. 
Thus coordinate differences must be multiplied by 4 to set the speed. 
Longer vectors must be drawn as (at most) 8 segments.

The display should be setup such that increasing both coordinates  move the point right and up;
increasing one and decreasing the other gives a reverse stroke.  

The polarity of the z-axis strobe can be selected by a jumper for each channel.

The charcter display function uses a chain of segements to speed up
writing; this requires a precise setup of the mid voltage
to 1.023V; otherwise the characters are blurred.

The schematics are updated, but requiere a revision. The PCB is not directly usable. 

## Displays
 
To display the vectors, the device must have analog inputs for x/y mode
and a digital (TTL) input for either blanking or unblanking. 
Both x/y inputs should use 5V (or 4V) to position the trace
to a square area filling the screen. 

Displays that work without modifications are:
- Grundig GO-40Z oszilloscope (with Z-option)
- Tektronix 1740A oszilloscope 
- Tektronix 611 storage display unit

The Tektronix 611 can be swiched to non-storage mode and internally wired
for +/- 1V sensitivity; the cable must contain a voltage divider 1:4.

Several other oscilloscopes have a Z option, but often either require
at least 20V to blank the trace. Moreover, often the Z input is 
designed for blanking small parts only, as internally a diode clamps a
capacitor that transmits the signal.

A Hameg HM512 was succesfully modified by reversing the diode and
adding internally a small amplifier to obtain larger voltage swing
from the Z-input.
